GOCDB-5.5 Release (02/12/2015 ). No DB schema changes.  
  - Added 'Action to take For all child service scopes' field when editing a 
    site so that the site's scopes can be easily inherited or used to override 
    all child service scopes. 
  - Adding <RECOGNISED_IN_PROJECTS/>  element to the XML output of the get_user
    query to show which projects a user's roles apply to. This is needed for 
    multi-tenant where a single GOC instance can host multiple projects.  
  - Adding <SCOPES/> element to the XML output of the following PI queries: 
    get_site, get_service, get_service_endpoint, get_ngi, get_service_group 
  - Adding 'jquery.multiple.select.js' lib to allow selecting of multiple scopes when 
    filtering sites/services/ngis/sgs in the GUI. This also required use of PI queries to 
    create new service methods in order to take advantage of the filtering by 
    multiple scopes with scope and scope_match params.  
  - Bug fix to allow comma chars in the values of custom extension properties.  
    The presence of a comma in the value of an ext prop was previously clashing 
    with the ScopeQueryBuilder which explodes the scope string on commas. The 
    fix removes this clash.    
  - Adding JQuery Table sorter lib and applied to sorting of many tables including
    custom properties and downtimes. 
  - Role mapping and abstractions to define different roles on a per-project
    basis. Different roles are defined in the RoleActionMappings.xml 
    file. The mapping file defines which actions are enabled 
    for each role. The role types have to be pre-inserted into the DB.     
    This could be extended to define different role types per project 
    (with this release, users can have different role instances per project, but
    the role types are consistent across projects). 
  - New improved ExtensionsParser2.php implementation for tokenising  
    the value of the 'extensions' URL param in PI - the value 
    part of key=value expressions can now contain any char including escaped 
    parenthesis and html special chars. Note, this does not affect the input 
    interface which still restricts which chars are allowed in property values. 
    To support input of any char in a property value, the regex rules for validating
    input need to be updated, and the property values need to be rendered in 
    CDATA sections in the PI output (i.e. rather than using htmlspecialchars() 
    on the value, sample logic to do this is provided in getSite()).  
  - Bug fix, when ending/editing a downtime, the returned downtime->dateTime 
    properties are in the server's default timezone and not UTC, this caused problems 
    in time/duration calculations when applied to ending/ending downtimes. The downtime
    editing logic has been updated to convert the downtime dateTimes to UTC before
    performing time calculations. A single global call to date_default_timezone_set("UTC")
    has also been re-added to the index.php file to treat all times in UTC. 
  - Bug fix, ShibAuthToken uses $_SERVER['eppn'] to fetch eduPersonPrincipleName 
 

GOCDB-5.4 Release (06/07/2015). Includes DB schema changes.  
  - Addition of RoleActionRecord entity for recording all role request actions (deny, approve, revoke). 
  - Improved Role approve/deny page rendering and logic.
  - Improved deployment scripts and install docs. 
  - Updated OwnedEntity.php to add abstract getName() method for runtime polymorphism. 
  - Addition of transient decoratorObject on Role entity for decorating Role instance with
    extra non-persistent info (for enhanced view rendering).    
  - Updated SimpleSamlPhpAuthToken.php to show how to support multiple IdPs.  
  - Updated front controller (index.php) to allow permitAll pages and authentication 
    on a per-page basis. 
  - Improved content rendering to hide Edit/Delete links according to permissions. 
  - Update to php timezonedb rather than by static seed values insert into DB, inc:  
    Deprecation of the lib/Doctrine/entities/Timezone.php entity. 
  - Specify downtime dates in site's local timezone with automatic conversion to UTC 
    Removal of extraneous date_default_timezone_set("UTC") calls (legacy artefact) 
    Improved add/edit downtime interface 
  - BugFix - get_service method was ignoring the `monitored` url parameter. 
  - BugFix - limit to reachable sites when adding downtimes 
  - Addition of ShibAuthToken.php for easier integration with ShibSP. 
  - Modified 'lib/Authentication/AuthProviders/GOCDBAuthProvider.php' to support 
    any non-null IAuthentication token by default, rather than limiting to known 
    sub-classes. 
    
    

GOCDB-5.3.1 Release (16/02/2015) 
  - Addition of static GocContextPath.php to allow deployment of GOCDB in other 
    environments such as a Symfony component (allows web assets to be located 
    in a different directory as required by environment).
  - Addition of static SecurityContextSource.php as a storage object for external 
    security context objects that may be set to authenticate users in other 
    environments such as a a Symfony component. 
  - Major improvements to Authentication package to enable different auth schemes. 
  - Support for SAML2.0 SSO logins using SimpleSamlPhp (disabled by default).  
  - Update DB entity model to add new value (User->$username1) and new script 
    (QueryPopulateSSO_UsernameRunner.php) to query the EGI Idp to populate this value. 
  - Update of get_user PI method (GetUser.php): 
    - ENTITY_TYPE element values updated ( 'group' value is separated into 'ngi' and 'project')
    - New elements: SSOUSERNAME and PRIMARY_KEY (PK of the target role entity). 
  - xecho() and xssafe() methods added in view layer to add extra protection against XSS attacks. 
  - Throw early exceptions if PK/ID values _REQUEST are not numeric. 
  - Prototyped new regex for extensions expression parsing to allow escaped chars including 
      escaped parenthesis (not implemented yet).

- Extensive refactoring at all layers to use Doctrine entities.
- By design: the 'external' interfaces (PI and portal GUI) have few outwardly visible 
  changes to be backward compatible. 
- Simpler backend Role model impl (role classifications dropped) so that 
  a role over an OwnedEntity has a single role type name and a single status (PENDING or GRANTED) 
- New Authentication abstraction layer to abstract x509 details from the underlying
  code and facilitate new authentication mechanisms such as un/pw via well defined 
  IAuthProvider and IAuthMananger interfaces. 
- Support for multiple Projects, e.g. EGI, EUDAT, PRACE in a single GOCDB instance. 
- Scoping extensions to allow resources to be tagged with multiple scope-tags

GOCDB-4.2 Release (25-11-2011) 
This release includes scoping of sites and service endpoints. 
A GOCDB instance (whether central or regional) needs to differentiate between EGI and non-EGI data. To do this, new tagging logic had been added so that new data sc
oping rules can be applied to GOCDB entities, allowing Sites, Services and other data to be identified as either ‘EGI,’ ‘Local’ or ‘some other’ scoped data. This is
 a regionalisation prerequisite. By default, sites and services are defined in the 'EGI' scope. 
- Scoping of sites and service endpoints - Nov 2011 https://rt.egi.eu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=2789

GOCDB-4.1 Release (01-11-2011)
This release sees some changes to the to the PROM database APIs and to the MVC view logic. 
Importantly, the PLSQL package name has been updated from 'pgridcore' to 'pgridcore2' to reflect these changes. 
New functionality has also been added. Details below. 

- Refactored PROM db API. The underlying database code has been refactored for greater flexibility and stability:
  All changes to the database are now atomic, allowing transactions to be explicitly demarcated within business routines. 
  Database interactions are now performed through a formalised PROM interface API that is agnostic of the database implementation, currently only implemented for Or
acle.
  (Before v4.1, the GOCDB PROM API did not allow transaction demarcation in high level business operations, such as
  inserting a site and adding new SE because explicit commits and rollbacks were declared in low-level PLSQL functions 
  including fnNewLink(), fnUpdateObject(), fnDeleteObject(), fnDeleteLink(). Consequently, any business operation that 
  invoked these functions multiple times in a single processing unit was not atomic, and gocdb 4.0 could leave the db 
  in an inconsistent state if an error occurred since full rollback was not possible (e.g. on site creation Savannah 74860). 
  This almost certainly accounted for a number of previously reported data inconsistencies. Refactoring the database logic 
  was therefore high priority and is a regionalisation pre-requisite; either all or none of the data should be committed 
  to the central gocdb when publishing from regional to central). 
- Refactored much of the code base initially to support scoping but also to provide more flexibility long term, especially the MVC view layer. 
  This will make future change requests easier to fulfill and gives us more flexibility to make user interface improvements.
  (Before v4.1, GOCDB used a generic module for drawing all forms and GUI components such as tables. This module defined a single 
  code path which was too rigid, making it difficult to deal with form/table requirements on a per-page basis). 
- New View Site page (to support scoping and to address user issues with the current View Site page) 
- New View Service Endpoint page
- Added current UTC time to new Downtime page
- Refactored database code to be atomic (required to implement scoping) - Oct 2011 (release into production end Oct/start-Nov) https://rt.egi.eu/rt/Ticket/Display.h

RL field is displayed per Endpoint, a new Gocdb_Endpoint_Location entity was created in order to link multiple service endpoint locations per SE if this becomes a f
uture requirement - see Media:GocdbGlue2UnicoreV2.pdf).
